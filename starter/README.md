# console-finances-challenge

# Overview
This project involves JavaScript code to analyze financial records, specifically the finances dataset provided in index.js. The goal is to calculate key financial metrics, including total months, net total Profit/Losses, average changes in Profit/Losses, and identifying the greatest increase and decrease in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

# Project Structure
index.js: Contains the financial dataset and JavaScript code for analysis.

# Objectives:
Upon running the analysis, the console will display key financial metrics such as total months, net total Profit/Losses, average changes, and the greatest increase/decrease in Profit/Losses. Through this challenge will develop experience with loops, the creation and manipulation of arrays and consolidate the javascript lessons from the week prior.

# Reflections:
This project was very challening and required a lot of researching on how to input values into a 2-dimensional array and use that array to determine the maximum and minimum values. I have been able to grow significantly from this project and I'm greatful I was able to solve the challenge in the end.
